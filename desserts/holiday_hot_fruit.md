Holiday Hot Fruit
=================

* 1 (16oz) can sliced peaches
* 1 (16oz) can pear halves
* 1 (16oz) can apricots
* 1 (16oz) can pineapple chunks
* 1 can mandarin oranges
* 1/3 c brown sugar
* 1 tsp cinnamon
* 1/4 tsp ground clobes
* dash of nutmeg
* 1/4 lb butter

Drain all of the fruit. Pat it with a paper towel when drained. In a saucepan, melt the butter, then mix in brown sugar and spices. Mix up fruit in a 3 or 4-quart casserole. Pour melted butter, sugar, and spices over fruit. Mix. Bake at 325 for 45 minutes to an hour. Server 8

For more than 8 people, I add cut up apples (skinned), dry apricots, and pitted prunes or just add a couple of more cans of the fruit and a little more brown sugar.
